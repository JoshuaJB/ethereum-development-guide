# The Button demo dApp

This is a dApp written as a demo for the Ethereum development guide, inspired by Reddit's [The Button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)) experiment. Read more about it in [the guide](https://github.com/jimpo/ethereum-development-guide#using-a-dapp).

## Running the frontend

The frontend is written in JavaScript, using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and ES2017 language features. This project uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile the source to JavaScript supported in modern browsers.

From this directory run the following:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Compile and run a development server
$ npm start

# Build asset bundle for deployment
$ npm run-script build
```
